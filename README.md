# Statistical Learning
Final project for the Statistical Learning course I took during my master's degree. The aim of the project was to draw insights from the [Open University Learning Analytics dataset](https://analyse.kmi.open.ac.uk/open_dataset), with respect to the students' performance.

In this case, the outcome of the courses was categorized as "Successful" or "Unsuccessful".
The objective was to identify relationships among the variables and develop an interpretable model that is capable of classifying new instances (i.e., students attempting a course) into these two categories. To achieve this, we employed and compared five different approaches: logistic regressions and their classifiers, linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, the naive Bayes model and the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm. It's worth emphasizing that the primary focus of this project was not solely data classification, but also acquiring a deeper understanding of the available information.

The project was conducted by using R Markdown.
